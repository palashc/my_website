I am a Master's student in the [Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) department at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My interests include Distributed Systems, Machine Learning and the intersection of the two. I was a Software Developer in the [Adobe Media Optimizer](https://www.adobe.com/in/advertising-cloud/media-optimizer.html) team at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) where I built a streaming architeture for search advertising attribution. I graduated from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) in 2017 with a major in Computer Science and Engineering. In the summer of 2016, I interned at [Adobe BigData Experience Lab](https://research.adobe.com/about-adobe-research/bigdata-experience-lab/) where I worked on integrating a Topic Model based prediction system within Adobe Illustrator.

My hobbies include reading and playing all kinds of sports - Badminton, TT, Tennis, Squash, Basketball. I was a member of the Badminton team at IIT Kanpur and won several tournaments for the institute.
